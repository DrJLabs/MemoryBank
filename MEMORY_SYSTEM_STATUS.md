## üîÑ Memory Integration Best Practices

### For AI Assistants
1. **Before responding**: Use `ai-context "query" [type]` to get relevant context
2. **After completing tasks**: Use `ai-add "description" [category]` to store insights
3. **For specific contexts**: Use category-specific commands like `ai-ctx-tech`

### For Users
1. **Store important information**: `ai-add "your information" [category]`
2. **Search past interactions**: `ai-search "topic" [category]`
3. **Get analytics**: `ai-analytics` for system overview
4. **Access UI**: `mem-ui` opens visual interface at http://localhost:3010
