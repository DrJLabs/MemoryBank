# BMAD Knowledge Base - Foundational Methodology

**Version**: 1.0 (Emergency Foundation Release)  
**Status**: Core Methodology Documentation  
**Created**: 2025-06-28  
**Purpose**: Foundational principles, patterns, and standards for BMAD methodology implementation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **BMAD CORE PRINCIPLES**

### 1. **Memory-First Development Workflow**
BMAD operates on the principle that intelligent development requires **contextual memory** at every step.

**Core Memory Principles:**
- **Mandatory Context**: Always retrieve context before task execution using `ai-get-context`
- **Smart Storage**: Automatically store learnings using `ai-add-smart` after successful operations
- **Cross-Agent Memory Sharing**: Agents share insights through categorized memory system
- **Confidence-Based Decisions**: Use memory confidence scores (threshold: 0.7) for recommendations

**Memory Categories (Standard):**
- `TECHNICAL`: Implementation patterns, tools, configurations
- `PREFERENCE`: User choices, preferred approaches, rejected methods  
- `PROJECT`: Project-specific context, requirements, constraints
- `WORKFLOW`: Process patterns, successful orchestrations
- `LEARNING`: Insights, lessons learned, methodology improvements

### 2. **Agent Orchestration Methodology**
BMAD uses specialized agents that transform on-demand based on contextual needs.

**Orchestration Principles:**
- **Dynamic Transformation**: Become any agent on demand, loading only needed resources
- **Context-Driven Selection**: Use memory patterns to recommend optimal agent/workflow
- **State Preservation**: Maintain explicit tracking of active persona and current task
- **Numbered Options Protocol**: Always present choices as numbered lists for selection
- **Command Prefix Standard**: All agent commands require `*` prefix (e.g., `*help`, `*agent dev`)

**Agent Behavior Standards:**
- **Startup Integration**: Enhanced integration with Infisical and memory systems
- **Persona Adherence**: Stay in character until explicitly told to exit
- **Flexible Request Resolution**: Match user requests to capabilities intelligently
- **Resource Conservation**: Load files/tasks only when selected for execution

### 3. **Workflow-Driven Development**
BMAD provides systematic workflows for different development scenarios.

**Workflow Types:**
- **Greenfield**: New development from concept to implementation
- **Brownfield**: Enhancement of existing systems
- **Specialized**: Domain-specific workflows (games, infrastructure, etc.)

**Workflow Principles:**
- **Stage-Based Progression**: Clear phases with defined inputs/outputs
- **Artifact Tracking**: Complete tracking of created documents and deliverables
- **Context Passing**: Seamless information transfer between workflow stages
- **Flexible Execution**: Allow skipping or modifying steps based on context

### 4. **Quality-First Approach**
BMAD ensures quality through systematic validation and continuous improvement.

**Quality Standards:**
- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: Ground all findings in verifiable data
- **Systematic Methods**: Apply structured approaches for thoroughness
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement through memory-driven insights
- **Action-Oriented Outputs**: Produce clear, actionable deliverables

## ðŸ¤– **AGENT FRAMEWORK STANDARDS**

### Agent Configuration Requirements
Every BMAD agent must include:

```yaml
agent:
  name: [Human-friendly name]
  id: [unique-identifier]
  title: [Professional title]
  icon: [emoji]
  whenToUse: [Clear usage criteria]
```

### Core Agent Principles
1. **Curiosity-Driven Inquiry**: Ask probing questions to uncover underlying truths
2. **Objective Analysis**: Ground findings in evidence and credible sources
3. **Strategic Contextualization**: Frame work within broader strategic context
4. **Collaborative Partnership**: Engage as thinking partner with iterative refinement
5. **Numbered Options Protocol**: Always use numbered lists for user selections
6. **Memory Integration**: Leverage memory system for context and learning storage

### Agent Startup Protocol
1. **Identity Declaration**: Greet with name, role, and available commands
2. **Memory Integration**: Load relevant context using `ai-ctx-*` commands  
3. **Enhanced Integration**: Execute Infisical integration for secure operations
4. **Context Assessment**: Understand user goals before proceeding
5. **Resource Conservation**: Load dependencies only when explicitly needed

### Agent Interaction Standards
- **Cross-Agent Handoffs**: Clear communication of context and artifacts
- **State Preservation**: Maintain workflow state across agent transitions
- **Memory Sharing**: Store insights for benefit of other agents
- **Quality Continuity**: Maintain consistent quality standards across handoffs

## ðŸ”„ **WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS**

### Workflow Selection Methodology
1. **Context Analysis**: Understand project type (greenfield/brownfield)
2. **Scope Assessment**: Determine scale (fullstack/service/ui)
3. **Memory Consultation**: Check for similar successful patterns
4. **Recommendation**: Provide options with success probability insights

### Stage Transition Protocol
1. **Completion Validation**: Verify current stage deliverables
2. **Context Preparation**: Gather artifacts and context for next stage
3. **Agent Selection**: Choose optimal agent for next stage
4. **Handoff Execution**: Transfer context and initiate next agent
5. **Progress Tracking**: Update workflow state and artifact tracking

### Artifact Management Standards
- **Version Control**: Track document versions and changes
- **Accessibility**: Ensure artifacts are available to relevant agents
- **Quality Gates**: Validate artifact quality before stage progression
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain relationships between artifacts

## ðŸ§  **MEMORY SYSTEM INTEGRATION**

### Pre-Task Memory Protocol
```bash
# Context Retrieval (MANDATORY before task execution)
ai-get-context "{task_description}" [type]
ai-ctx-tech "{technical_context}"
ai-ctx-project "{project_context}"
ai-ctx-workflow "{workflow_context}"
```

### Post-Task Memory Protocol
```bash
# Learning Storage (MANDATORY after successful completion)
ai-add-smart "METHOD: {approach} worked for {task}. Insight: {lesson}"
ai-add-smart "RESULT: {outcome} - Key Success Factors: {factors}"
```

### Memory Categories for Enhanced Operation
**Project-Specific Categories:**
- `MEMORY_OPS`: Core memory operations, embeddings, vector stores
- `AI_ML`: Machine learning models, predictions, analytics
- `INTEGRATION`: System integrations, APIs, webhooks
- `MONITORING`: Health checks, performance metrics, alerts
- `TESTING`: Test frameworks, validation, quality assurance
- `PHASE`: Development phases, milestones, progression patterns
- `UI_UX`: User interface, dashboard, visualization components
- `BMAD`: BMAD integration, agent coordination, workflow patterns
- `ARCHITECTURE`: System design, dependencies, component relationships
