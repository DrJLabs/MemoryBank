## üéØ **OVERVIEW**

BMAD agent interactions require **systematic coordination** to maintain workflow continuity, context preservation, and quality standards across agent transitions. This document defines the formal protocols for seamless agent collaboration.

### Core Interaction Principles

1. **Context Preservation**: Complete state transfer across agent transitions
2. **Memory Continuity**: Shared learning and insights across agents  
3. **Quality Consistency**: Maintained standards throughout workflow progression
4. **Explicit Handoffs**: Clear communication of responsibilities and deliverables
5. **State Transparency**: Visible workflow progress and current status

## üîÑ **AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOLS**

### Standard Handoff Procedure

Every agent transition must follow this **5-phase handoff protocol**:

#### Phase 1: Pre-Handoff Context Preparation
**Outgoing Agent Responsibilities:**
1. **Complete Current Tasks**: Ensure all active work reaches stable checkpoint
2. **Gather Handoff Context**: Compile artifacts, decisions, and constraints
3. **Store Insights**: Execute `ai-add-smart` with key learnings and patterns
4. **Validate Deliverables**: Confirm all outputs meet quality standards
5. **Prepare Transition Summary**: Create concise handoff documentation

**Required Information Package:**
- **Completed Artifacts**: All deliverables created during agent session
- **Active Context**: Current project state, requirements, and constraints  
- **Decision History**: Key decisions made and rationale
- **Quality Status**: Validation results and any outstanding issues
- **Next Steps**: Recommended actions for incoming agent

#### Phase 2: Orchestrator Coordination
**BMAD Orchestrator Responsibilities:**
1. **Validate Readiness**: Confirm outgoing agent completion and deliverable quality
2. **Select Next Agent**: Choose optimal agent based on workflow stage and memory patterns
3. **Prepare Context Package**: Aggregate all relevant artifacts and context
4. **Announce Transition**: Clear communication of agent change and handoff
5. **Initiate Next Agent**: Transform with full context and handoff package

#### Phase 3: Incoming Agent Activation
**Incoming Agent Startup Protocol:**
1. **Identity Declaration**: Announce name, role, and capabilities
2. **Enhanced Integration**: Execute Infisical and memory system integration
3. **Context Retrieval**: Load relevant context using `ai-get-context` and `ai-ctx-*` commands
4. **Handoff Review**: Acknowledge received artifacts and validate context understanding
5. **Next Steps Confirmation**: Confirm understanding of expected deliverables and approach

#### Phase 4: Context Validation
**Mutual Validation Requirements:**
1. **Artifact Verification**: Incoming agent confirms access to all required deliverables
2. **Context Understanding**: Demonstrate comprehension of project state and requirements
3. **Quality Continuity**: Commit to maintaining established quality standards
4. **Scope Confirmation**: Verify understanding of role boundaries and responsibilities
5. **Issue Escalation**: Identify any gaps or concerns requiring orchestrator attention

#### Phase 5: Workflow Continuation
**Smooth Transition Execution:**
1. **Status Update**: Update workflow state with new agent and current stage
2. **Memory Integration**: Load agent-specific context and successful patterns
3. **Task Initiation**: Begin first task with full context awareness
4. **Progress Tracking**: Establish clear progress indicators and checkpoints
5. **Continuous Communication**: Maintain transparency with user and orchestrator

## üß† **MEMORY INTEGRATION STANDARDS**

### Cross-Agent Memory Sharing

**Memory Categories for Agent Collaboration:**
- `WORKFLOW`: Process patterns, successful orchestrations, handoff experiences
- `TECHNICAL`: Implementation approaches, tool choices, technical decisions
- `PROJECT`: Project-specific context, requirements evolution, constraint changes
- `QUALITY`: Standards applied, validation approaches, issue resolution patterns
- `COLLABORATION`: Agent interaction patterns, effective handoff strategies

### Pre-Agent Memory Protocol

**Required Context Loading (MANDATORY):**
```bash
# Load general context for task
ai-get-context "{task_description}" [type]

# Load technical context for agent role
ai-ctx-tech "{agent_domain_expertise}"

# Load project-specific context
ai-ctx-project "{current_project_phase}"

# Load workflow context
ai-ctx-workflow "{current_workflow_stage}"

# Load collaboration patterns
ai-ctx-workflow "agent {previous_agent} to {current_agent} handoff"
```

### Post-Agent Memory Protocol

**Required Learning Storage (MANDATORY):**
```bash
# Store agent-specific learnings
ai-add-smart "AGENT {agent_id}: {task_type} - Approach: {method} - Result: {outcome} - Insight: {lesson}"

# Store collaboration patterns
ai-add-smart "HANDOFF: {from_agent} ‚Üí {to_agent} - Context: {handoff_context} - Effectiveness: {rating} - Improvement: {suggestion}"

# Store workflow insights
ai-add-smart "WORKFLOW: {workflow_stage} - Agent: {agent_id} - Success Factors: {factors} - Lessons: {insights}"

# Store quality patterns
ai-add-smart "QUALITY: {validation_type} - Standards: {applied_standards} - Results: {outcomes} - Patterns: {reusable_approaches}"
```

### Memory-Driven Decision Making

**Agent Selection Enhancement:**
- **Context Check**: `ai-search "similar {task_type}" WORKFLOW` before agent recommendation
- **Pattern Application**: Use successful handoff patterns from memory for optimal transitions
- **Preference Respect**: Honor user preferences for agent types and collaboration styles stored in memory
- **Continuous Improvement**: Apply lessons learned from previous agent interactions
