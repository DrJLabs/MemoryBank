# Performance Benchmarking Plan

This document outlines the plan for performance benchmarking the Custom GPT Adapter service.

## Scope

The scope of the benchmarking will be focused on the key API endpoints:

-   `POST /auth/token`
-   `POST /auth/refresh`
-   `POST /search`
-   `POST /memories`

## Objectives

-   Determine the baseline performance of the service under various load conditions.
-   Identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
-   Validate the scalability of the service.

## Plan

1.  **Tooling:** We will use a tool like `locust` or `jmeter` to generate load for the benchmarking tests.
2.  **Test Scenarios:** We will create test scenarios that simulate realistic user behavior, including:
    -   A mix of authentication, search, and memory creation requests.
    -   Varying levels of concurrent users.
3.  **Metrics:** We will measure the following key metrics:
    -   Requests per second (RPS)
    -   Average, median, and 95th percentile latency
    -   Error rates
4.  **Analysis:** The results of the benchmarking tests will be analyzed to identify performance characteristics and areas for improvement.
