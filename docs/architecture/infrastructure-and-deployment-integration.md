# Infrastructure and Deployment Integration

*The adapter service deployment is completely independent from your existing Memory Bank Service infrastructure, allowing separate scaling and management.*

## Existing Infrastructure (Unchanged)

**Current Deployment:** Docker Compose with automated maintenance and monitoring
**Infrastructure Tools:** Docker, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, monitoring dashboard
**Environments:** Development, staging, production with health scoring

## Enhancement Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Approach:** Independent Docker Compose stack, separate from core service
**Infrastructure Changes:** New containers and services, zero changes to existing infrastructure
**Pipeline Integration:** Separate CI/CD pipeline, independent deployment lifecycle
