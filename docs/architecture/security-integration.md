# Security Integration

*The adapter service implements enterprise-grade security completely independent from your existing Memory Bank Service security infrastructure.*

## Existing Security Measures (Unchanged)

**Authentication:** Existing Memory Bank Service authentication remains unchanged
**Authorization:** Existing Memory Bank Service authorization unchanged
**Data Protection:** Existing Memory Bank Service data protection unchanged
**Security Tools:** Existing Memory Bank Service security tools unchanged

## Enhancement Security Requirements

**New Security Measures:** 
- OAuth 2.0 server with JWT token management
- Per-Custom GPT application credentials and permissions
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Comprehensive audit logging and monitoring

**Integration Points:** 
- Adapter service consumes Memory Bank Service APIs as authenticated external client
- Independent security perimeter with separate attack surface
- Zero security dependencies on core service

**Compliance Requirements:**
- Enterprise OAuth 2.0 implementation
- Audit trail for all Custom GPT operations
- Data privacy protection for Custom GPT conversations
- Secure credential storage and rotation

## Security Testing

**Existing Security Tests:** Memory Bank Service security tests remain unchanged
**New Security Test Requirements:** 
- OAuth 2.0 flow security testing
- JWT token validation and expiration testing
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention testing
- Penetration testing for adapter service endpoints

**Penetration Testing:** Independent security assessment for adapter service with isolated scope
