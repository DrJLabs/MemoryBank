# Risk Assessment and Mitigation

*Risks are completely isolated to the adapter service with comprehensive mitigation strategies that ensure zero impact on your existing Memory Bank Service.*

## Technical Risks

**Risk:** Adapter service failure or performance issues
**Impact:** Low - Custom GPT functionality affected, core Memory Bank Service unimpacted
**Likelihood:** Medium - New service implementation risks
**Mitigation:** Circuit breakers, health checks, independent monitoring, graceful degradation

**Risk:** Memory Bank Service API changes breaking adapter service integration
**Impact:** Medium - Adapter service functionality affected, core service unimpacted
**Likelihood:** Low - Existing APIs are stable
**Mitigation:** API versioning, comprehensive integration tests, API change monitoring

**Risk:** OAuth security vulnerabilities in adapter service
**Impact:** Medium - Custom GPT access security compromised, core service unaffected
**Likelihood:** Low - Industry-standard OAuth implementation
**Mitigation:** Security audits, penetration testing, secure credential management

## Operational Risks

**Risk:** Adapter service resource consumption impacting host system
**Impact:** Low - Independent resource allocation and monitoring
**Likelihood:** Low - Separate containerization and resource limits
**Mitigation:** Resource monitoring, auto-scaling, independent deployment

**Risk:** Custom GPT usage overwhelming Memory Bank Service APIs
**Impact:** Medium - Core service performance could be affected
**Likelihood:** Medium - High Custom GPT usage scenarios
**Mitigation:** Rate limiting, circuit breakers, request queuing, separate resource pools

**Risk:** Adapter service deployment issues
**Impact:** Low - Core service deployment unaffected
**Likelihood:** Medium - New deployment pipeline
**Mitigation:** Blue-green deployment, rollback procedures, independent deployment validation

## Monitoring and Alerting

**Enhanced Monitoring:** 
- Independent Prometheus/Grafana stack for adapter service
- Custom GPT request metrics and performance monitoring
- OAuth authentication success/failure rates
- Memory Bank Service API consumption patterns

**New Alerts:**
- Adapter service health and availability alerts
- Custom GPT authentication failure threshold alerts
- Memory Bank Service API error rate alerts
- Resource utilization alerts for adapter service

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Response time monitoring for Custom GPT operations
- Memory Bank Service API call latency tracking
- Message queue processing time monitoring
- Database performance metrics for adapter service
