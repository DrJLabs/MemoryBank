# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack (Unchanged)

**Languages**: Python 3.12+ with FastAPI framework
**Frameworks**: FastAPI (REST API), SQLAlchemy (ORM), Pydantic (data validation)
**Database**: PostgreSQL primary with SQLite development support, Qdrant vector database
**Infrastructure**: Docker containerized microservices with Docker Compose orchestration
**External Dependencies**: OpenAI API, 20+ LLM providers, Qdrant vector store, MCP server

## New Custom GPT Adapter Service Technology Stack

**Service Architecture**: Standalone FastAPI microservice with separate deployment lifecycle
**Database**: Dedicated PostgreSQL database for Custom GPT metadata and audit logs
**Message Queue**: Redis for asynchronous memory operation processing
**Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, separate from core service authentication
**Monitoring**: Dedicated monitoring stack with Prometheus/Grafana

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Separate Custom GPT adapter database, communicates with Memory Bank Service via existing REST APIs only
**API Integration Strategy**: Adapter service exposes new REST endpoints, consumes existing Memory Bank Service APIs as external client
**Message Processing Strategy**: Asynchronous processing using Redis message queue for memory operations
**Security Integration Strategy**: OAuth 2.0 authentication with per-Custom GPT application credentials, separate from core service
**Monitoring Integration Strategy**: Separate monitoring infrastructure for adapter service, existing core service monitoring unchanged

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- New microservice: `custom-gpt-adapter/` (separate repository/directory)
- Service structure: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/routers/`, `custom-gpt-adapter/app/services/`, `custom-gpt-adapter/app/models/`
- Message processors: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/workers/`
- OAuth implementation: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/auth/`

**Naming Conventions**: Standard FastAPI microservice conventions with `custom_gpt_` prefix
**Coding Standards**: FastAPI best practices, separate from core service coding standards
**Documentation Standards**: Independent OpenAPI documentation for adapter service

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process**: Independent Docker containerization and CI/CD pipeline
**Deployment Strategy**: Separate deployment from core Memory Bank Service, can be deployed/updated independently
**Monitoring and Logging**: Dedicated logging and monitoring infrastructure separate from core service
**Configuration Management**: Independent configuration management, environment variables for Memory Bank Service API endpoints

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- OpenAI API changes could break Custom GPT adapter service
- Redis message queue failures could cause memory operation delays
- Adapter service database issues could impact Custom GPT functionality

**Integration Risks**: 
- Memory Bank Service API changes could break adapter service integration
- Network connectivity issues between adapter service and core service
- Authentication token expiration could interrupt Custom GPT sessions

**Deployment Risks**: 
- Adapter service deployment issues do not impact core Memory Bank Service
- Independent scaling requirements for adapter service
- Separate monitoring infrastructure complexity

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Circuit breakers and fallback responses for OpenAI API calls
- Redis clustering for message queue high availability
- Comprehensive API versioning for Memory Bank Service integration
- Health checks and automated recovery for adapter service
- Blue-green deployment for adapter service updates
- Zero impact on core service - complete isolation ensures core service remains unaffected
