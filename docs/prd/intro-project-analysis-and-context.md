## Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: 
- [x] Integration with New Systems

**Enhancement Description**: Create a dedicated Custom GPT Adapter Service that provides secure, scalable integration between ChatGPT Custom GPTs and the existing Memory Bank Service, using asynchronous processing and enterprise-grade security patterns.

**Impact Assessment**: 
- [x] Minimal Impact (isolated additions)

The enhancement creates a separate microservice that interfaces with existing Memory Bank Service APIs, ensuring complete isolation and zero risk to production systems.

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable ChatGPT Custom GPTs to search and retrieve memories through a dedicated adapter service
- Allow Custom GPTs to create and store new memories asynchronously with enterprise security
- Provide scalable memory context to Custom GPTs without impacting core service performance
- Implement enterprise-grade OAuth 2.0 security separate from core service authentication
- Ensure zero impact on existing Memory Bank Service through complete architectural isolation

### Background Context

The Memory Bank Service currently provides enterprise memory management to AI assistants through comprehensive APIs and semantic search. With the growing adoption of ChatGPT Custom GPTs for specialized tasks, there's a need to connect these Custom GPTs with the enterprise memory system to provide continuity, context, and learning capabilities. Rather than modifying the production Memory Bank Service, this enhancement creates a dedicated Custom GPT Adapter Service that acts as a secure bridge between Custom GPTs and the existing memory management capabilities, ensuring zero risk to the production system while providing full integration capabilities.
