# Epic 1: Custom GPT Adapter Service Development

**Epic Goal**: Build a dedicated Custom GPT Adapter Service that provides secure, scalable integration between ChatGPT Custom GPTs and the existing Memory Bank Service, ensuring zero impact on core service while delivering enterprise-grade memory capabilities to Custom GPTs.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Create independent microservice that consumes existing Memory Bank Service APIs
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication separate from core service
- Build asynchronous message processing for memory operations
- Establish separate monitoring and deployment infrastructure

*This story sequence is designed to eliminate all risk to your existing Memory Bank Service by building a completely separate adapter service. Each story builds the adapter service incrementally while ensuring zero impact on your core service. Does this risk-free approach make sense given your need to maintain production system stability?*

## Story 1.1: Custom GPT Adapter Service Foundation

As a system administrator,
I want to establish the Custom GPT Adapter Service foundation with independent infrastructure,
so that Custom GPT integration can be developed without any impact on the core Memory Bank Service.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Separate Custom GPT Adapter Service repository and development environment created
- AC2: Independent FastAPI application with basic health check endpoints
- AC3: Dedicated PostgreSQL database for adapter service metadata and audit logs
- AC4: Redis message queue infrastructure for asynchronous processing
- AC5: Independent Docker containerization and deployment configuration
- AC6: Separate monitoring infrastructure with basic metrics and logging

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Core Memory Bank Service remains completely unmodified and unaffected
- IV2: Adapter service can be deployed and removed without any impact on core service
- IV3: All infrastructure is independent - no shared dependencies with core service

## Story 1.2: OAuth Authentication and Memory Bank Service Integration

As a system administrator,
I want to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and Memory Bank Service API integration,
so that the adapter service can securely access memory operations without compromising core service security.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: OAuth 2.0 server implemented with JWT token generation and validation
- AC2: Per-Custom GPT application credential management with granular permissions
- AC3: Memory Bank Service API client implemented using existing REST endpoints
- AC4: Circuit breaker pattern implemented for Memory Bank Service API calls
- AC5: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic for external API communication
- AC6: Token refresh and rotation mechanisms for long-running Custom GPT sessions

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Memory Bank Service authentication and authorization systems remain unchanged
- IV2: Adapter service acts as standard API client - no special access or modifications required
- IV3: Core service performance unaffected by adapter service API consumption

## Story 1.3: Custom GPT Memory Search API

As a ChatGPT Custom GPT,
I want to search memories using natural language queries through the adapter service,
so that I can provide contextually relevant responses based on stored knowledge.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: `/api/v1/search` endpoint in adapter service for Custom GPT memory search requests
- AC2: OAuth token validation for incoming Custom GPT requests
- AC3: Asynchronous memory search processing using Redis message queue
- AC4: Search request forwarding to Memory Bank Service using existing search APIs
- AC5: Search results formatted specifically for Custom GPT consumption with relevance scores
- AC6: Comprehensive audit logging of all Custom GPT search activities

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Memory Bank Service search functionality remains completely unaffected
- IV2: Core service performance maintained - adapter service handles all Custom GPT load
- IV3: Existing Memory Bank Service users experience no impact from Custom GPT searches

## Story 1.4: Custom GPT Memory Creation API

As a ChatGPT Custom GPT,
I want to create new memories during conversations through the adapter service,
so that I can store insights and information for future reference.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: `/api/v1/memories` POST endpoint in adapter service for Custom GPT memory creation
- AC2: Asynchronous memory creation processing with immediate acknowledgment to Custom GPT
- AC3: Memory creation requests queued in Redis and processed by background workers
- AC4: Background workers forward memory creation to Memory Bank Service APIs
- AC5: Custom GPT memories tagged with source identification and conversation context
- AC6: Created memories immediately available for search once processed

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Memory Bank Service memory creation functionality remains completely unaffected
- IV2: Core service database schema unchanged - all Custom GPT data stored in adapter service
- IV3: Existing memory creation performance unimpacted by Custom GPT usage

## Story 1.5: Rate Limiting and Performance Management

As a system administrator,
I want to implement rate limiting and performance management for the adapter service,
so that Custom GPT usage cannot impact Memory Bank Service performance.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Per-Custom GPT rate limiting with configurable limits and time windows
- AC2: Request queuing and throttling to prevent Memory Bank Service overload
- AC3: Performance monitoring with response time and throughput metrics
- AC4: Automatic circuit breaker activation for Memory Bank Service protection
- AC5: Resource usage monitoring for adapter service scaling decisions
- AC6: Graceful degradation patterns when limits are exceeded

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Memory Bank Service performance remains completely unaffected by Custom GPT load
- IV2: Core service rate limiting and performance management unchanged
- IV3: Adapter service can be scaled independently without impacting core service

## Story 1.6: Monitoring, Documentation, and Production Readiness

As a developer,
I want comprehensive monitoring, documentation, and production readiness for the adapter service,
so that the Custom GPT integration is reliable, maintainable, and production-ready.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Comprehensive test suite for adapter service with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- AC2: Independent monitoring dashboard for adapter service health and performance
- AC3: Complete API documentation for adapter service endpoints and OAuth flows
- AC4: Deployment automation and CI/CD pipeline for adapter service
- AC5: Security audit and penetration testing for adapter service
- AC6: Disaster recovery and backup procedures for adapter service
- AC7: Performance benchmarking to validate adapter service scalability

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Memory Bank Service tests continue to pass unchanged - zero impact verification
- IV2: Core service documentation remains unmodified
- IV3: Production Memory Bank Service performance shows zero degradation
- IV4: Adapter service can be completely removed without any trace in core service

*This epic structure ensures that the Custom GPT Adapter Service is built as a completely independent system that provides full Custom GPT integration capabilities while maintaining absolute zero impact on your existing Memory Bank Service infrastructure and operations.*
