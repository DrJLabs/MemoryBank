### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

- Enable ChatGPT Custom GPTs to search and retrieve memories through a dedicated adapter service
- Allow Custom GPTs to create and store new memories asynchronously with enterprise security
- Provide scalable memory context to Custom GPTs without impacting core service performance
- Implement enterprise-grade OAuth 2.0 security separate from core service authentication
- Ensure zero impact on existing Memory Bank Service through complete architectural isolation

#### Background Context

The Memory Bank Service currently provides enterprise memory management to AI assistants through comprehensive APIs and semantic search. With the growing adoption of ChatGPT Custom GPTs for specialized tasks, there's a need to connect these Custom GPTs with the enterprise memory system to provide continuity, context, and learning capabilities. Rather than modifying the production Memory Bank Service, this enhancement creates a dedicated Custom GPT Adapter Service that acts as a secure bridge between Custom GPTs and the existing memory management capabilities, ensuring zero risk to the production system while providing full integration capabilities.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack (Unchanged)

**Languages**: Python 3.12+ with FastAPI framework
**Frameworks**: FastAPI (REST API), SQLAlchemy (ORM), Pydantic (data validation)
**Database**: PostgreSQL primary with SQLite development support, Qdrant vector database
**Infrastructure**: Docker containerized microservices with Docker Compose orchestration
**External Dependencies**: OpenAI API, 20+ LLM providers, Qdrant vector store, MCP server

### New Custom GPT Adapter Service Technology Stack

**Service Architecture**: Standalone FastAPI microservice with separate deployment lifecycle
**Database**: Dedicated PostgreSQL database for Custom GPT metadata and audit logs

**Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens, separate from core service authentication
**Monitoring**: Dedicated monitoring stack with Prometheus/Grafana

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Separate Custom GPT adapter database, communicates with Memory Bank Service via existing REST APIs only
**API Integration Strategy**: Adapter service exposes new REST endpoints, consumes existing Memory Bank Service APIs as external client
**Message Processing Strategy**: Asynchronous processing using Redis message queue for memory operations
**Security Integration Strategy**: OAuth 2.0 authentication with per-Custom GPT application credentials, separate from core service
**Monitoring Integration Strategy**: Separate monitoring infrastructure for adapter service, existing core service monitoring unchanged

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- New microservice: `custom-gpt-adapter/` (separate repository/directory)
- Service structure: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/routers/`, `custom-gpt-adapter/app/services/`, `custom-gpt-adapter/app/models/`
- Message processors: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/workers/`
- OAuth implementation: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/auth/`

**Naming Conventions**: Standard FastAPI microservice conventions with `custom_gpt_` prefix
**Coding Standards**: FastAPI best practices, separate from core service coding standards
**Documentation Standards**: Independent OpenAPI documentation for adapter service

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process**: Independent Docker containerization and CI/CD pipeline
**Deployment Strategy**: Separate deployment from core Memory Bank Service, can be deployed/updated independently
**Monitoring and Logging**: Dedicated logging and monitoring infrastructure separate from core service
**Configuration Management**: Independent configuration management, environment variables for Memory Bank Service API endpoints

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- OpenAI API changes could break Custom GPT adapter service
- Redis message queue failures could cause memory operation delays
- Adapter service database issues could impact Custom GPT functionality

**Integration Risks**: 
- Memory Bank Service API changes could break adapter service integration
- Network connectivity issues between adapter service and core service
- Authentication token expiration could interrupt Custom GPT sessions

**Deployment Risks**: 
- Adapter service deployment issues do not impact core Memory Bank Service
- Independent scaling requirements for adapter service
- Separate monitoring infrastructure complexity

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Circuit breakers and fallback responses for OpenAI API calls
- Redis clustering for message queue high availability
- Comprehensive API versioning for Memory Bank Service integration
- Health checks and automated recovery for adapter service
- Blue-green deployment for adapter service updates
- Zero impact on core service - complete isolation ensures core service remains unaffected
