# Story 1.1: Custom GPT Adapter Service Foundation

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a system administrator
- I want to establish the Custom GPT Adapter Service foundation with independent infrastructure
- so that Custom GPT integration can be developed without any impact on the core Memory Bank Service

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Separate Custom GPT Adapter Service repository and development environment created
- AC2: Independent FastAPI application with basic health check endpoints
- AC3: Dedicated PostgreSQL database for adapter service metadata and audit logs
- AC4: Redis message queue infrastructure for asynchronous processing
- AC5: Independent Docker containerization and deployment configuration
- AC6: Separate monitoring infrastructure with basic metrics and logging

  - [x] Define initial SQLAlchemy models for CustomGPTApplication, CustomGPTSession, CustomGPTAuditLog
  - [x] Set up Alembic for database migrations
  - [x] Create initial migration for adapter service tables
- [x] Task 4: Configure Redis message queue infrastructure (AC: 4)
  - [x] Set up Redis connection in `app/core/redis.py`
  - [x] Create Celery application configuration in `app/workers/celery_app.py`
  - [x] Implement basic task queue structure for async processing
  - [x] Create placeholder memory processor in `app/workers/memory_processor.py`
- [x] Task 5: Create Docker containerization (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create `docker/Dockerfile.api` for FastAPI application
  - [x] Create `docker/Dockerfile.worker` for Celery workers
  - [x] Create `docker/docker-compose.yml` with all services (API, Worker, PostgreSQL, Redis)
  - [x] Configure environment variables and volume mounts
- [x] Task 6: Set up monitoring infrastructure (AC: 6)
  - [x] Create Prometheus configuration in `monitoring/prometheus.yml`
  - [x] Add metrics endpoint to FastAPI application
  - [x] Configure basic logging setup with structured logs
  - [x] Create placeholder for Grafana dashboards
- [x] Task 7: Write comprehensive unit tests for foundation components
  - [x] Create test structure in `tests/` directory
  - [x] Write unit tests for health check endpoint
  - [x] Write unit tests for database connection
  - [x] Write unit tests for Redis connection
  - [x] Ensure 90% code coverage target

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the epic, establishing the foundation for all subsequent stories.

### Data Models
The following data models need to be created in the adapter service database [Source: architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md#New Data Models]:

**CustomGPTApplication**:
- id: UUID - Primary key
- name: String - Human-readable application name
- client_id: String - OAuth 2.0 client identifier
- client_secret: String - Encrypted OAuth 2.0 client secret
- permissions: JSON - Granular permissions
- rate_limits: JSON - Rate limiting configuration
- created_at: DateTime
- last_used: DateTime

**CustomGPTSession**:
- id: UUID - Primary key
- application_id: UUID - Foreign key to CustomGPTApplication
- access_token: String - JWT access token
- refresh_token: String - JWT refresh token
- expires_at: DateTime
- last_activity: DateTime

**CustomGPTAuditLog**:
- id: UUID - Primary key
- application_id: UUID - Foreign key to CustomGPTApplication
- operation_type: Enum (search, create, authenticate)
- request_data: JSON - Sanitized request payload
- response_status: Integer
- processing_time: Float
- memory_service_request_id: String
- created_at: DateTime

### API Specifications
Health check endpoint specification [Source: architecture/api-design-and-integration.md]:
- Method: GET
- Endpoint: `/health`
- Response: Standard health check with service status

### Component Specifications
No UI components in this foundation story.

### File Locations
All new code should be created in `custom-gpt-adapter/` directory following this structure [Source: architecture/source-tree-integration.md#New File Organization]:
- `app/api/v1/endpoints/health.py` - Health check endpoint
- `app/core/config.py` - Application configuration
- `app/core/database.py` - Database connection setup
- `app/core/redis.py` - Redis connection setup
- `app/models/` - SQLAlchemy models
- `app/workers/celery_app.py` - Celery configuration
- `docker/` - Docker configuration files
- `monitoring/` - Monitoring configuration

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.12+ required [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- FastAPI latest version [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- PostgreSQL 13+ for adapter database [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Redis 7.0+ for message queue [Source: architecture/tech-stack-alignment.md]
- Independent from Memory Bank Service - no shared dependencies [Source: architecture/component-architecture.md]

### Testing Requirements
Testing should follow pytest with async support, located in `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests for New Components]

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [x] pytest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: false), coverage requirement: 90%
- [ ] pytest Integration Test: location: `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/integration/`
- [ ] E2E: Not required for foundation story

Manual Test Steps:
- Run `docker-compose up` in `custom-gpt-adapter/docker/` directory
- Verify all services start successfully (API, Worker, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Access health endpoint at `http://localhost:8000/health`
- Verify PostgreSQL database has adapter tables created
- Check Redis connection is established
- Verify Prometheus metrics are exposed at `/metrics`
