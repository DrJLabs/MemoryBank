# Story 1.7: Operational Deployment and Integration

## Status: In Progress

## Story

- As a system administrator,
- I want to deploy and operationalize the Custom GPT Adapter Service,
- so that it can be used in production with real Custom GPT integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Service deployed to production environment with proper configuration management
- AC2: Integration with real Memory Bank Service validated and functioning
- AC3: First Custom GPT application registered and operational
- AC4: Operational tooling in place (alerting, log aggregation, runbooks)
- AC5: API documentation published and accessible
- AC6: Production monitoring and alerting configured
- AC7: Deployment automation scripts created and tested
- AC8: Load testing completed and performance validated

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Environment Configuration and Secrets Management** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create production environment configuration files
  - [ ] Set up environment variables for production (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, etc.)
  - [ ] Configure Memory Bank Service API credentials
  - [ ] Set up JWT secret keys for OAuth implementation
  - [ ] Create `.env.production` template with all required variables

- [ ] **Task 2: Deploy to Production Infrastructure** (AC: 1, 7)
  - [ ] Create production deployment scripts in `scripts/deploy/`
  - [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL database and run migrations
  - [ ] Deploy Redis instance for message queue
  - [ ] Deploy API and Worker containers using docker-compose
  - [ ] Configure reverse proxy/load balancer
  - [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates

- [ ] **Task 3: Validate Memory Bank Service Integration** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Configure Memory Bank Service API endpoint and credentials
  - [ ] Test search functionality against real Memory Bank Service
  - [ ] Test memory creation with real service
  - [ ] Verify circuit breaker behavior under load
  - [ ] Document any integration issues and resolutions

- [ ] **Task 4: Create First Custom GPT Application** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create management script for Custom GPT applications
  - [ ] Register first application with credentials
  - [ ] Configure appropriate permissions and rate limits
  - [ ] Test OAuth flow with registered application
  - [ ] Document application setup process

- [ ] **Task 5: Set Up Operational Tooling** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Configure log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack or CloudWatch)
  - [ ] Set up alerting rules in Grafana
  - [ ] Create runbooks for common operations:
    - Application registration
    - Troubleshooting authentication issues
    - Database backup/restore
    - Service restart procedures
  - [ ] Create operational dashboard for support team

- [ ] **Task 6: Publish API Documentation** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Generate OpenAPI specification from FastAPI
  - [ ] Deploy API documentation site (e.g., ReDoc or Swagger UI)
  - [ ] Create developer guide for Custom GPT integration
  - [ ] Document authentication flow with examples
  - [ ] Publish rate limiting guidelines

- [ ] **Task 7: Configure Production Monitoring** (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Import Grafana dashboard to production monitoring
  - [ ] Configure alerting thresholds:
    - High error rate (>1%)
    - High latency (>2s p95)
    - Circuit breaker open
    - Queue backup
  - [ ] Set up PagerDuty/Slack integration for alerts
  - [ ] Create SLO/SLA monitoring

- [ ] **Task 8: Performance Validation** (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Create load testing scripts using locust or k6
  - [ ] Test with expected production load (concurrent Custom GPTs)
  - [ ] Validate rate limiting under load
  - [ ] Measure Memory Bank Service impact
  - [ ] Document performance characteristics and limits

## Dev Notes

### Prerequisites
- Production infrastructure provisioned
- Access to Memory Bank Service production API
- SSL certificates obtained
- Monitoring infrastructure available

### Configuration Requirements
Production environment variables needed:
```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/custom_gpt_adapter_prod

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://host:6379/0

# Memory Bank Service
MEMORY_BANK_API_URL=https://api.memorybank.example.com
MEMORY_BANK_API_KEY=<production-api-key>

# OAuth/Security
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<strong-secret-key>
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_EXPIRATION_MINUTES=60

# Service Config
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
WORKERS=4
```

### Security Considerations
- Ensure all secrets are properly managed (consider using HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)
- Enable HTTPS for all endpoints
- Review and implement security audit recommendations
- Enable audit logging for all operations

### Testing Requirements
- Integration tests against production Memory Bank Service (read-only)
- Load testing to validate performance requirements
- Chaos testing for resilience validation

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep previous version containers available
2. Database migration rollback scripts ready
3. Quick switch via load balancer
4. Monitor for 24 hours after deployment
