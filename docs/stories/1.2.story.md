# Story 1.2: OAuth Authentication and Memory Bank Service Integration

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a system administrator,
- I want to implement OAuth 2.0 authentication and Memory Bank Service API integration,
- so that the adapter service can securely access memory operations without compromising core service security.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: OAuth 2.0 server implemented with JWT token generation and validation
- AC2: Per-Custom GPT application credential management with granular permissions
- AC3: Memory Bank Service API client implemented using existing REST endpoints
- AC4: Circuit breaker pattern implemented for Memory Bank Service API calls
- AC5: Comprehensive error handling and retry logic for external API communication
- AC6: Token refresh and rotation mechanisms for long-running Custom GPT sessions

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement OAuth 2.0 Server (AC: 1, 2, 6)
  - [x] Create `/auth/token` endpoint as per API specification.
  - [x] Implement JWT generation logic with access and refresh tokens.
  - [x] Add token validation middleware for protected endpoints.
  - [x] Enhance `CustomGPTApplication` model to store permissions and credentials securely.
  - [x] Implement token refresh flow.
- [x] Task 2: Implement Memory Bank Service API Client (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create a dedicated API client module for interacting with the Memory Bank Service.
  - [x] Use the existing REST endpoints for search and memory creation.
  - [x] Authenticate with the Memory Bank Service as a standard external client.
- [x] Task 3: Implement Circuit Breaker and Error Handling (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Integrate a circuit breaker library (e.g., `pybreaker`) into the API client.
  - [x] Configure exponential backoff for retries on failed API calls.
  - [x] Implement comprehensive error logging for all external API interactions.
- [x] Task 4: Define and Document Rollback Strategy (AC: 5)
  - [x] Document rollback procedures for the authentication service deployment.
  - [x] Identify key metrics to monitor for a rollback decision.
- [x] Task 5: Document New Endpoints
  - [x] Document OAuth endpoints and usage in API documentation.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the foundational infrastructure. This story builds upon it by adding the critical security and integration layers. No major blockers were identified in the previous story.

### API Specifications
- **OAuth Endpoint**: `POST /auth/token`
- **Request**: `{"grant_type": "client_credentials", "client_id": "...", "client_secret": "...", "scope": "..."}`
- **Response**: `{"access_token": "...", "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 3600, ...}`

### Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback Strategy**: A documented rollback plan is required before deployment.
- **Feature Flags**: Consider implementing feature flags for the OAuth integration in a future story to allow for safer, incremental rollouts.

### Security Requirements
- Implement a self-contained OAuth 2.0 server using JWTs.
- Store client credentials securely.
- Permissions should be managed on a per-application basis in the `CustomGPTApplication` model.
- [Source: architecture/security-integration.md]

### External API Integration
- API calls to the Memory Bank Service MUST be wrapped in a circuit breaker.
- Use retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- [Source: architecture/external-api-integration.md]

### Testing

Dev Note: Story Requires the following tests:

- [ ] pytest Unit Tests: (nextToFile: false), coverage requirement: 90%
- [ ] pytest Integration Test: location: `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/integration/`
- [ ] E2E: Not required for this story

Manual Test Steps:
- Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to request a token from the `/auth/token` endpoint.
- Attempt to access a protected (future) endpoint with and without a valid token.
- Simulate Memory Bank Service API failures to verify the circuit breaker opens and closes correctly.
