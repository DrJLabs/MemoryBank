# Story 1.4: Custom GPT Memory Creation API

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a ChatGPT Custom GPT,
- I want to create new memories during conversations through the adapter service,
- so that I can store insights and information for future reference.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `/api/v1/memories` POST endpoint in adapter service for Custom GPT memory creation
- AC2: Asynchronous memory creation processing with immediate acknowledgment to Custom GPT
- AC3: Memory creation requests queued in Redis and processed by background workers
- AC4: Background workers forward memory creation to Memory Bank Service APIs
- AC5: Custom GPT memories tagged with source identification and conversation context
- AC6: Created memories immediately available for search once processed

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create the Memory Creation API Endpoint** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] In `custom-gpt-adapter/app/api/v1/endpoints/memories.py`, create a `POST /api/v1/memories` endpoint.
  - [x] Implement Pydantic models for the request and response bodies.
  - [x] The endpoint should accept the memory content and any context, and immediately return a `202 Accepted` response with a request ID.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Asynchronous Memory Creation** (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create a Celery task in `custom-gpt-adapter/app/workers/memory_processor.py` called `process_memory_creation`.
  - [x] This task will take the memory data and call the `MemoryBankClient` to create the memory in the core service.
  - [x] Ensure the source application and conversation context are passed as metadata to the Memory Bank Service.

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Asynchronous Audit Logging** (AC: 6)
  - [x] In the `process_memory_creation` task, after the memory is created, log the activity to the audit log.
  - [x] The log entry should include the final status from the Memory Bank Service.

- [x] **Task 4: Write Unit and Integration Tests**
  - [x] Write unit tests for the `/api/v1/memories` endpoint.
  - [x] Write unit tests for the `process_memory_creation` Celery task.
  - [x] Write integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 completed the search API. This story adds the ability to create memories.

### API Specifications
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/memories`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "content": "The user wants to learn about reinforcement learning.",
    "context": {
      "custom_gpt_id": "gpt-custom-123",
      "conversation_id": "conv-456"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Success Response (202 Accepted)**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Memory creation request received. It will be processed asynchronously.",
    "request_id": "req-abc-123"
  }
  ```

### Integration Verification

- IV1: Memory Bank Service memory creation functionality remains completely unaffected
- IV2: Core service database schema unchanged - all Custom GPT data stored in adapter service
- IV3: Existing memory creation performance unimpacted by Custom GPT usage
