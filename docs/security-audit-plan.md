# Security Audit and Penetration Testing Plan

This document outlines the plan for conducting a security audit and penetration testing for the Custom GPT Adapter service.

## Scope

The scope of the audit and testing will be limited to the Custom GPT Adapter service, including:

-   All API endpoints
-   The OAuth 2.0 implementation
-   The database schema and data handling
-   The Docker container configurations

## Objectives

-   Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities in the application and its infrastructure.
-   Ensure compliance with industry best practices for security.
-   Verify that the service is protected against common attack vectors, such as those listed in the OWASP Top 10.

## Plan

1.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** We will use a SAST tool to scan the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
2.  **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** We will use a DAST tool to scan the running application for vulnerabilities.
3.  **Penetration Testing:** We will engage a third-party security firm to conduct a comprehensive penetration test of the service.
4.  **Remediation:** All identified vulnerabilities will be triaged, prioritized, and remediated.
