# Test Suite Analysis & Optimization Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2025-07-03

## 1. Overview

This document tracks the ongoing analysis and optimization of the automated test suites for the MemoryBank monorepo.  It is a living artifact referenced by BMAD agents to coordinate quality-assurance work.

Goals:
1. Provide a clear inventory of existing tests.
2. Highlight coverage gaps, outdated or overlapping suites.
3. Recommend modern, scalable improvements (e.g., property-based, mutation, AI-generated tests, performance/load suites).
4. Define a phased roadmap and module-specific checklists.

---

## 2. Current Test Inventory (high-level)

| Stack / Area | Directory | Test Types | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Custom GPT Adapter** | `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/` | e2e, API endpoint, client | Good functional coverage but lacks property-based & perf tests |
| **MemoryBank Core (Python)** | `tests/` | unit, property, integration, scenario | Largest suite; some duplication & flaky integration tests |
| **mem0 TypeScript libs** | `mem0/**/tests/` | unit (Jest/Vitest) | No e2e or contract tests; coverage unknown |
| **Monitoring / Metrics** | `scripts/`, `monitoring/` | _none detected_ | Needs unit & integration tests |
| **Infrastructure / Docker** | `docker/`, `server/` | _none detected_ | Suggest smoke tests & container health checks |
| **BMAD Agents & CLI** | `.bmad-core`, `scripts/` | limited unit tests | Extend with behavior & property-based tests |

> Detailed inventory tables per directory will be generated as part of task **T2_component_mapping**.

---

## 3. Gap Analysis (completed)

> **Summary:** The analysis below consolidates findings from inventory **T1–T2** and provides a prioritized list of gaps that will drive upcoming tasks **T5–T7**.

### 3.1 Coverage Gaps

| Stack / Area | Missing Test Types | Rationale / Impact |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Custom GPT Adapter | Property-based, load/perf, fuzz | Critical external interface – needs robustness & throughput validation |
| MemoryBank Core (Python) | Load/perf, mutation, smoke | Largest code surface; flakiness points at unhandled concurrency |
| mem0 TS libs | E2E, contract/integration | Library consumed by external packages – breakage risk |
| Monitoring / Metrics | Unit, integration, contract | Observability is untested – silent failures possible |
| Infrastructure / Docker | Smoke, health checks | Deployment reliability depends on container health |
| BMAD Agents & CLI | Behavior, property | Deterministic agent behaviour essential for workflows |

### 3.2 Duplication & Redundancy
* Duplicate **`test_memory_bank_client.py`** exists in both `tests/clients` and `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/clients`. Consolidate into shared fixture.
* Overlapping auth/rate-limit tests in core and adapter suites – unify under contract tests.
* Legacy experimental suites in `archive/experimental/*` no longer align with current architecture.

### 3.3 Flakiness & Stability
* 4 integration tests intermittently fail in CI due to shared DB state (`tests/integration/test_reset_manager.py`, error `ForeignKeyViolation`). Marked for isolation or containerised DB fixture.
* High memory usage observed during `ai_memory_tests.py`; investigate async resource cleanup.

### 3.4 Security & Fuzzing
* No structured fuzzing across any stack.
* Lack of boundary tests for untrusted user input on search APIs – high risk.

### 3.5 Observability
* Metrics exporter (`scripts/dependency-metrics-exporter.py`) has zero tests – blind spot for reliability.
* Prometheus/Grafana provisioning files not validated in CI.

### 3.6 Tooling & CI
* Coverage not enforced – current mean ~62 %. Recommend gate at 80 % minimum.
* No mutation testing – unknown test effectiveness.
* Codacy quality gates integrated but thresholds lenient; tighten after addressing critical gaps.

**Priority Matrix**

| Priority | Gap Category | Proposed Action (linked task) |
|----------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| P0 | Flakiness in core integration tests | Fix isolation, add retries (T7) |
| P0 | Missing tests for Monitoring/Infrastructure | Introduce smoke & unit tests (T6) |
| P1 | Coverage gaps in Custom GPT Adapter | Property & fuzz suites (T6) |
| P1 | Duplicate client tests | Consolidate & DRY fixtures (T5) |
| P2 | Absence of load/performance suites | Add Locust/k6 scenarios (T7) |
| P2 | Lack of mutation testing | Integrate Mutmut/Stryker (T5) |

---

## 4. Recommendations Snapshot

1. Introduce Hypothesis-based property tests for API payload validation.
2. Add Locust/k6 load tests for critical endpoints.
3. Implement mutation testing (e.g., Mutmut, Stryker) to gauge suite effectiveness.
4. Consolidate duplicated client tests; migrate to shared fixtures.
5. Gate CI on coverage % and Codacy quality metrics.

## 9. Best Practices & Next-Gen Techniques

This consolidated research (task **T5**) provides guidance on modern testing strategies to address the gaps identified in Section 3.  Teams should selectively adopt techniques based on module priority and risk.

### 9.1 Property-Based & Fuzz Testing
* Use [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) for Python and *fast-check* or *jsverify* for TypeScript to generate randomized inputs and edge cases automatically.
* Integrate [Atheris](https://github.com/google/atheris) or `python-fuzz` for coverage-guided fuzzing of critical parsers and API payloads.

### 9.2 Mutation Testing
* Python: [Mutmut](https://mutmut.readthedocs.io/)  — run via `pytest-mutmut` in CI to ensure assertions catch behavioural changes.
* TypeScript: [Stryker-JS](https://stryker-mutator.io/)  — configure with a ≥60 % mutation-score threshold to start.

### 9.3 Contract & Schema Tests
* Adopt [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/) for consumer-driven contracts between microservices and external clients.
* Enforce OpenAPI/JSON-Schema validation in tests using tools such as `schemathesis` (Python) or `openapi-validators` (TS).

### 9.4 Load & Performance
* Use [Locust](https://locust.io/) (Python) and [k6](https://k6.io/) (JS) to create baseline latency/throughput budgets.  Gate pull requests when regressions >10 % are detected.

### 9.5 Observability & Infrastructure Validation
* Leverage [`pytest-testinfra`](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/) for container and provisioning checks.
* Validate Prometheus rules with [`promtool test rules`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/unit_testing_rules/).

### 9.6 AI-Assisted Test Generation
* Integrate GitHub Copilot-generated tests with manual review to accelerate coverage, ensuring that mutation testing protects against superficial assertions.

### 9.7 Documentation & Traceability
* Maintain a **project notebook** or ADRs to capture testing decisions and parameters, following traceability recommendations from the Open University's guidance on software development documentation [[source](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/approaches-software-development/content-section-2.4.1)].

> Implementation of these practices will be scheduled during **Phase 2** (checklists & adoption) and **Phase 3** (execution) of the roadmap.
