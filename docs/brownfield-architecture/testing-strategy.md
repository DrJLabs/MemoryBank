# Testing Strategy

*The adapter service has a completely independent test suite that validates functionality without impacting your existing Memory Bank Service test infrastructure.*

## Integration with Existing Tests

**Existing Test Framework:** Memory Bank Service test suite remains completely unchanged
**Test Organization:** Independent test organization, separate from core service tests
**Coverage Requirements:** Independent coverage targets for adapter service

## New Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests for New Components

- **Framework:** pytest with async support
- **Location:** `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/unit/`
- **Coverage Target:** 90% code coverage for adapter service
- **Integration with Existing:** No integration - completely independent test suite

### Integration Tests

- **Scope:** Adapter service integration with Memory Bank Service APIs
- **Existing System Verification:** Adapter service tests verify API consumption patterns
- **New Feature Testing:** Custom GPT integration scenarios and OAuth flows

### End-to-End Tests

- **Scope:** Complete Custom GPT workflow testing
- **Test Environment:** Independent test environment with Memory Bank Service API mocking
- **Automated Testing:** CI/CD pipeline with automated test execution

### Regression Testing

- **Existing Feature Verification:** Memory Bank Service regression tests remain unchanged
- **Automated Regression Suite:** Independent adapter service regression testing
- **Manual Testing Requirements:** Custom GPT integration scenarios and performance testing
