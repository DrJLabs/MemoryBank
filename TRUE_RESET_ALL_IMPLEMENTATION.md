# Fix #2: True reset_all() Command - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Critical Issue**: The original reset method had significant limitations:
- Only cleared vector store and history, leaving graph residues
- Graph reset used `delete_all(filters={"user_id": "default"})` which only deleted default user's data
- No control over what gets reset - it was all or nothing
- No dry-run capability to preview deletions
- No way to preserve specific data while resetting others

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Core Components Added

#### 1. **ResetManager** (`mem0/mem0/memory/reset_manager.py`)
- **Configurable reset scopes**: Choose what to reset (vector, graph, history, or combinations)
- **True graph reset**: Uses `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n` to remove ALL nodes and relationships
- **Dry-run mode**: Preview what would be deleted without executing
- **Preserve filters**: Keep specific user/agent data while resetting others
- **Thread-safe operations**: Uses RLock for concurrent access safety

#### 2. **ResetOptions Configuration**
- **ResetScope enum**: Defines granular reset targets
  - `ALL`: Reset everything (default)
  - `VECTOR_ONLY`: Reset only vector store
  - `GRAPH_ONLY`: Reset only graph store
  - `HISTORY_ONLY`: Reset only history database
  - `VECTOR_AND_HISTORY`: Keep graph, reset others
  - `GRAPH_AND_HISTORY`: Keep vector, reset others

#### 3. **CLI Interface** (`mem0/mem0/cli/reset.py`)
- **Flexible command-line options**:
  - `--keep-vector`: Preserve vector store data
  - `--keep-graph`: Preserve graph store data
  - `--keep-history`: Preserve history database
  - `--dry-run`: Preview deletions without executing
  - `--force`: Skip confirmation prompt
  - `--preserve-user <id>`: Keep specific user's data
  - `--preserve-agent <id>`: Keep specific agent's data

#### 4. **Enhanced Memory Class Methods**
- Updated `reset()` method accepts `ResetOptions` parameter
- Backward compatible - calling without options does full reset
- Returns detailed results including what was reset

### Key Features

#### üéØ **True Graph Reset**
```python
def _full_graph_reset(self):
    """Completely reset the graph store - delete ALL nodes and relationships"""
    cypher = """
    MATCH (n)
    DETACH DELETE n
    """
    self.graph_store.graph.query(cypher, params={})
```

This ensures ALL graph data is removed, not just specific user data.

#### üîç **Reset Preview (Dry Run)**
```python
# Preview what would be deleted
memory.reset(ResetOptions(dry_run=True))

# Returns:
{
    "success": True,
    "dry_run": True,
    "summary": {
        "components_to_reset": ["vector_store", "graph_store", "history_database"],
        "estimated_deletions": {
            "vector_memories": 150,
            "graph_nodes": "all nodes and relationships",
            "history_entries": 300
        }
    }
}
```

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Selective Reset**
```python
# Reset only vector store, keep graph and history
memory.reset(ResetOptions(scope=ResetScope.VECTOR_ONLY))

# Keep graph data, reset everything else
memory.reset(ResetOptions.from_cli_args(keep_graph=True))

# Preserve specific user's data while resetting others
memory.reset(ResetOptions(preserve_filters={"user_id": "alice"}))
```

### Usage Examples

#### Python API
```python
from mem0 import Memory
from mem0.memory.reset_manager import ResetOptions, ResetScope

memory = Memory()

# Full reset (default behavior)
memory.reset()

# Reset with options
options = ResetOptions(
    scope=ResetScope.VECTOR_AND_HISTORY,  # Keep graph
    dry_run=False,
    force=True
)
result = memory.reset(options)
```

#### Command Line Interface
```bash
# Full reset with confirmation
python -m mem0.cli.reset

# Keep graph data, reset vector and history
python -m mem0.cli.reset --keep-graph

# Dry run to see what would be deleted
python -m mem0.cli.reset --dry-run

# Force reset without confirmation, preserve user alice
python -m mem0.cli.reset --force --preserve-user alice

# Reset only the graph store
python -m mem0.cli.reset --keep-vector --keep-history
```

### Implementation Details

#### Reset Execution Flow
1. **Parse options** to determine reset scope
2. **Get summary** of what will be deleted
3. **Confirm action** (unless forced or dry-run)
4. **Execute reset** based on scope:
   - Vector: Call `delete_col()` or selective delete
   - Graph: Execute `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`
   - History: Drop and recreate history table
5. **Recreate stores** that were reset
6. **Return results** with success status and details

#### Error Handling
- Partial failures are captured and reported
- Each component reset is attempted independently
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Rollback not needed as operations are destructive by design

### Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- All reset scope combinations
- Dry-run functionality
- Preserve filters
- Error handling and partial failures
- Both sync and async implementations
- CLI argument parsing

Run tests:
```bash
python test_reset_manager.py -v
```

### Migration Guide

For existing code using the old reset:
```python
# Old way
memory.reset()  # Limited reset, graph residues remain

# New way (equivalent but better)
memory.reset()  # Full reset including complete graph cleanup

# New way with control
memory.reset(ResetOptions(scope=ResetScope.VECTOR_ONLY))  # Surgical reset
```
