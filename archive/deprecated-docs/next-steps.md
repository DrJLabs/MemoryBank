# Next Steps

## Story Manager Handoff

**Custom GPT Adapter Service Development Ready**

The brownfield architecture defines a completely independent Custom GPT Adapter Service that provides full ChatGPT Custom GPT integration capabilities while ensuring absolute zero impact on the existing Memory Bank Service.

**Key Integration Requirements Validated:**
- Independent microservice architecture confirmed with user
- OAuth 2.0 authentication separate from core service security
- Asynchronous processing to prevent core service performance impact
- Complete deployment isolation with separate infrastructure

**Existing System Constraints:**
- Core Memory Bank Service remains completely unmodified
- All integration through existing REST API consumption only
- Independent database and infrastructure with zero shared dependencies
- Rollback capability with complete adapter service removal

**First Story Implementation:**
Start with "Custom GPT Adapter Service Foundation" story to establish independent infrastructure, then proceed with OAuth authentication and Memory Bank Service integration.

**Emphasis on System Integrity:**
Every implementation checkpoint must verify zero impact on existing Memory Bank Service functionality and performance.

## Developer Handoff

**Implementation Ready - Zero Risk Architecture**

The Custom GPT Adapter Service architecture is designed for safe, independent development that eliminates all risk to your production Memory Bank Service.

**Technical Implementation Guide:**
- Follow standard FastAPI microservice patterns independent from core service
- Implement OAuth 2.0 with industry-standard security practices
- Use existing Memory Bank Service APIs as external client only
- Implement comprehensive error handling and circuit breaker patterns

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Independent PostgreSQL database for adapter service data
- Redis message queue for asynchronous memory operations
- OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for Custom GPT authentication
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack separate from core service

**Compatibility Requirements:**
- Consume Memory Bank Service APIs through standard REST client patterns
- Implement rate limiting to prevent impact on core service performance
- Use circuit breakers and graceful degradation for Memory Bank Service protection
- Maintain complete deployment isolation with independent Docker containers

**Implementation Sequencing:**
1. Establish independent adapter service foundation and infrastructure
2. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication server with JWT token management  
3. Build Memory Bank Service API client with circuit breaker patterns
4. Implement asynchronous message processing for memory operations
5. Add rate limiting and performance management
6. Complete monitoring, documentation, and production readiness

**Zero Impact Verification:**
Each implementation phase must include verification that the Memory Bank Service continues to operate normally without any performance degradation or functional impact.

*This architecture ensures that the Custom GPT integration provides full functionality while maintaining absolute zero risk to your existing production Memory Bank Service.*
