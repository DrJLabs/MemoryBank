# Enhancement Scope and Integration Strategy

*Based on my analysis, the integration approach I'm proposing takes into account your existing FastAPI microservices architecture, comprehensive API patterns, and enterprise security requirements. The adapter service boundaries respect your current architecture by consuming only public APIs and maintaining complete independence. Is this assessment accurate?*

## Enhancement Overview

**Enhancement Type:** Independent Microservice Integration
**Scope:** Custom GPT Adapter Service with zero core service modification
**Integration Impact:** Zero Impact - Complete architectural isolation

## Integration Approach

**Code Integration Strategy:** No integration - completely separate codebase and repository
**Database Integration:** Independent PostgreSQL database, consumes Memory Bank Service via REST APIs only
**API Integration:** Adapter service acts as standard API client to existing Memory Bank Service endpoints
**UI Integration:** Independent monitoring dashboard, existing Memory Bank Service UI unchanged

## Compatibility Requirements

- **Existing API Compatibility:** Zero changes - adapter service consumes existing APIs as external client
- **Database Schema Compatibility:** No changes - adapter service uses separate database schema
- **UI/UX Consistency:** No modifications to existing UI - separate adapter service management interface
- **Performance Impact:** Zero impact - complete isolation with independent resource pools
