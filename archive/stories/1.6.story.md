# Story 1.6: Monitoring, Documentation, and Production Readiness

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a developer,
- I want comprehensive monitoring, documentation, and production readiness for the adapter service,
- so that the Custom GPT integration is reliable, maintainable, and production-ready.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Comprehensive test suite for adapter service with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- AC2: Independent monitoring dashboard for adapter service health and performance
- AC3: Complete API documentation for adapter service endpoints and OAuth flows
- AC4: Deployment automation and CI/CD pipeline for adapter service
- AC5: Security audit and penetration testing for adapter service
- AC6: Disaster recovery and backup procedures for adapter service
- AC7: Performance benchmarking to validate adapter service scalability

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Finalize Test Suite** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Review and enhance the existing test suite to ensure 90%+ code coverage.
  - [x] Add end-to-end tests for the key user flows (authentication, search, memory creation).

- [x] **Task 2: Create Monitoring Dashboard** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create a Grafana dashboard configuration that visualizes the Prometheus metrics.
  - [x] The dashboard should include panels for error rates, latency, throughput, and Celery queue metrics.

- [x] **Task 3: Finalize API Documentation** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Review and update the API documentation to ensure it's complete and accurate.
  - [x] Add documentation for the search and memory creation endpoints.

- [x] **Task 4: Create CI/CD Pipeline** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment.
  - [x] The pipeline should run tests, build Docker images, and push them to a registry.

- [x] **Task 5: Security Audit and Benchmarking Plan** (AC: 5, 7)
  - [x] Create a document outlining a plan for a security audit and penetration testing.
  - [x] Create a document outlining a plan for performance benchmarking.

- [x] **Task 6: Finalize Disaster Recovery and Backup Procedures** (AC: 6)
  - [x] Review and update the disaster recovery and backup procedures.

## Dev Notes

This is the final story in the epic, focused on making the service production-ready.
