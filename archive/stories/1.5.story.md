# Story 1.5: Rate Limiting and Performance Management

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a system administrator,
- I want to implement rate limiting and performance management for the adapter service,
- so that Custom GPT usage cannot impact Memory Bank Service performance.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Per-Custom GPT rate limiting with configurable limits and time windows
- AC2: Request queuing and throttling to prevent Memory Bank Service overload
- AC3: Performance monitoring with response time and throughput metrics
- AC4: Automatic circuit breaker activation for Memory Bank Service protection
- AC5: Resource usage monitoring for adapter service scaling decisions
- AC6: Graceful degradation patterns when limits are exceeded

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Per-Application Rate Limiting** (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Use a library like `slowapi` to add rate limiting middleware to the FastAPI application.
  - [x] Configure the rate limiter to use the `CustomGPTApplication`'s `client_id` as the key.
  - [x] Store rate limit configurations on the `CustomGPTApplication` model.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Request Queuing and Throttling** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Implement a queuing mechanism for Celery tasks to control the concurrency of requests sent to the Memory Bank Service.
  - [x] This will prevent the adapter from overwhelming the core service.

- [x] **Task 3: Enhance Performance Monitoring** (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Add custom Prometheus metrics for request latency, throughput, and error rates, broken down by application.
  - [x] Monitor Celery queue length and task processing times.

- [x] **Task 4: Circuit Breaker Verification** (AC: 4)
  - [x] The `MemoryBankClient` already has a circuit breaker. Write tests to verify it opens and closes correctly under load.

- [x] **Task 5: Write Unit and Integration Tests**
  - [x] Write unit tests for the rate limiting logic.
  - [x] Write integration tests to verify the end-to-end rate limiting and throttling behavior.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.3 and 1.4 created the core API endpoints. This story adds essential production-readiness features to protect the core Memory Bank Service.

### Key Libraries
- `slowapi`: For rate limiting.
- `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`: For performance monitoring.
- `pybreaker`: For the circuit breaker (already implemented).
