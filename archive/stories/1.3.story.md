# Story 1.3: Custom GPT Memory Search API

## Status: Done

## Story

- As a ChatGPT Custom GPT,
- I want to search memories using natural language queries through the adapter service,
- so that I can provide contextually relevant responses based on stored knowledge.

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: `/api/v1/search` endpoint in adapter service for Custom GPT memory search requests
- AC2: OAuth token validation for incoming Custom GPT requests
- AC3: Asynchronous memory search processing using Redis message queue
- AC4: Search request forwarding to Memory Bank Service using existing search APIs
- AC5: Search results formatted specifically for Custom GPT consumption with relevance scores
- AC6: Comprehensive audit logging of all Custom GPT search activities

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 specified the OAuth and Memory Bank client implementation. This story builds on that by creating the first user-facing API endpoint. The OAuth implementation from 1.2 is a direct dependency.

### API Specifications
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/search`
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "query": "natural language search query",
    "limit": 10,
    "filters": {
      "categories": ["TECHNICAL", "PROJECT"],
      "date_range": {
        "start": "2024-01-01",
        "end": "2024-01-31"
      }
    },
    "context": {
      "custom_gpt_id": "gpt-custom-123",
      "conversation_id": "conv-456"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Success Response (200 OK)**:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "request_id": "req-789",
    "results": [
      {
        "memory_id": "mem-001",
        "content": "Memory content text",
        "relevance_score": 0.95,
        "metadata": {
          "category": "TECHNICAL",
          "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Security Requirements
- All requests to `/api/v1/search` MUST be authenticated using the OAuth 2.0 Bearer token flow established in Story 1.2.
- The endpoint must validate the token and its scopes before processing.
- [Source: `docs/architecture/security-integration.md`]

### Asynchronous Processing
- The search request should be published to a Redis queue for asynchronous processing by a Celery worker.
- The API should immediately return a request ID to the client while the worker handles the search. *Correction*: The epic implies synchronous search for results, but asynchronous processing for logging/auditing. The API should block until results are fetched, but logging should be offloaded. Let's stick to a synchronous API call that internally uses an async worker for the Memory Bank call and auditing.

### File Locations
- **API Endpoint**: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/api/v1/endpoints/search.py`
- **Celery Task**: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/workers/memory_processor.py` (for auditing)
- **Audit Model**: `custom-gpt-adapter/app/models/audit.py`
- [Source: `docs/architecture/source-tree-integration.md`]

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Cover the API endpoint logic, request validation, and correct task queuing. Coverage target is 90%. Place tests in `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/unit/`.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the endpoint's integration with the OAuth service and that search tasks are correctly forwarded to the (mocked) Memory Bank Service client. Place tests in `custom-gpt-adapter/tests/integration/`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create the Search API Endpoint** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] In `custom-gpt-adapter/app/api/v1/endpoints/search.py`, create a `POST /api/v1/search` endpoint.
  - [x] Implement Pydantic models for the request and response bodies as specified in the API design.
  - [x] Add an OAuth2 dependency to the endpoint to enforce token validation. [Source: `docs/architecture/security-integration.md`]

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Synchronous Search Logic** (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Within the search endpoint, call the `MemoryService` client (from Story 1.2) to perform the search against the Memory Bank Service.
  - [x] The call should be synchronous to return results directly to the user.
  - [x] Format the results from the Memory Bank Service into the specified response structure. [Source: `docs/architecture/api-design-and-integration.md`]

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Asynchronous Audit Logging** (AC: 3, 6)
  - [x] Create a Celery task in `custom-gpt-adapter/app/workers/memory_processor.py` called `log_search_activity`.
  - [x] The task should accept all necessary data (application ID, request data, response status) to create an audit log entry.
  - [x] From the search endpoint, after a successful search, dispatch the `log_search_activity` task to the Redis queue.
  - [x] Update the `CustomGPTAuditLog` model in `custom-gpt-adapter/app/models/audit.py` if needed to store search-specific information. [Source: `docs/architecture/data-models-and-schema-changes.md`]

- [x] **Task 4: Write Unit and Integration Tests**
  - [x] Write unit tests for the `/api/v1/search` endpoint, mocking the `MemoryService` client and Celery dispatcher.
  - [x] Write integration tests to verify the endpoint's integration with the OAuth service and that search tasks are correctly forwarded to the (mocked) Memory Bank Service client.
  - [x] Ensure all tests adhere to the project's testing strategy and achieve 90% coverage. [Source: `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`]
