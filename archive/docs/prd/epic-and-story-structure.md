# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single Epic - This enhancement represents building a separate Custom GPT Adapter Service that interfaces with the existing Memory Bank Service. All components work together as an independent microservice to provide Custom GPT integration capabilities with zero risk to the core service.

*Based on the critical technical analysis, this enhancement should be structured as a single epic because it represents building a completely separate adapter service that acts as a bridge between Custom GPTs and the existing Memory Bank Service. This approach eliminates all risks to the core service while providing full Custom GPT integration capabilities. Does this conservative, risk-free approach align with your integration goals?*
