# Requirements

*These requirements are based on my understanding of your existing Memory Bank Service system with its FastAPI architecture, MCP server, and comprehensive LLM integration. Please review carefully and confirm they align with your project's reality.*

## Functional

- FR1: A separate Custom GPT Adapter Service will provide ChatGPT Custom GPT integration without any changes to the core Memory Bank Service
- FR2: Custom GPTs will search memories using natural language queries through the dedicated adapter service REST API
- FR3: Custom GPTs will create new memories asynchronously with immediate acknowledgment and background processing
- FR4: Custom GPTs will receive relevant memory context through webhook callbacks for enhanced response generation
- FR5: The adapter service will maintain comprehensive audit logs of all Custom GPT interactions separate from core service logs
- FR6: Custom GPTs will authenticate using OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens and per-Custom GPT application credentials
- FR7: The adapter service will provide rate limiting isolation to prevent Custom GPT usage from impacting core service performance
- FR8: The system will handle Custom GPT failures gracefully with circuit breakers and fallback responses

## Non Functional

- NFR1: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 20%
- NFR2: Custom GPT integration must support enterprise-grade security and access controls
- NFR3: API response times for Custom GPT requests must be under 2 seconds for 95% of requests
- NFR4: The system must handle Custom GPT rate limits without impacting other Memory Bank Service users
- NFR5: Integration must maintain 99.9% uptime consistent with existing service levels
- NFR6: Custom GPT memory operations must be fully auditable and traceable
- NFR7: The enhancement must support horizontal scaling for multiple Custom GPT integrations

## Compatibility Requirements

- CR1: Zero changes to existing Memory Bank Service - 100% backward compatibility guaranteed
- CR2: Core database schema remains completely unchanged - adapter service uses separate database
- CR3: No modifications to existing MCP server, authentication, or core service components
- CR4: Current LLM provider integrations remain completely unaffected
- CR5: Existing authentication and authorization systems continue unchanged
- CR6: Core monitoring and alerting systems remain unmodified - adapter service has separate monitoring
