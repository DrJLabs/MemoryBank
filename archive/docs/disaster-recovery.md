# Disaster Recovery and Backup Procedures

This document outlines the disaster recovery and backup procedures for the Custom GPT Adapter service.

## Disaster Recovery

In the event of a catastrophic failure of the Custom GPT Adapter service, the following steps will be taken to restore service:

1.  **Isolate the Service:** The adapter service will be immediately isolated from the core Memory Bank Service to prevent any further impact.
2.  **Restore from Backup:** The adapter service's database will be restored from the most recent backup.
3.  **Redeploy Service:** The adapter service will be redeployed to a new, stable environment.
4.  **Verify Service Health:** The service will be thoroughly tested to ensure it is operating normally before being brought back into production.

## Backup Procedures

-   **Database:** The PostgreSQL database for the adapter service will be backed up daily, with backups retained for 30 days.
-   **Configuration:** All service configurations are managed in code and version controlled in Git.
-   **Docker Images:** All Docker images are stored in a private registry and can be redeployed at any time.

## Rollback Procedure

The adapter service is designed to be independent, so a rollback is straightforward.

1.  **Disable Service:** The service will be scaled down to zero replicas in our container orchestration platform. This will immediately stop all traffic to the adapter service.
2.  **Verify Core Service Health:** We will immediately verify that the core Memory Bank Service is operating normally with the adapter service disabled.
3.  **Revert Deployment:** The previous stable version of the adapter service will be redeployed.

Because the adapter service is entirely separate, this process will have zero impact on the core Memory Bank Service.
