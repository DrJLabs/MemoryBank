# Memory-C* Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Deliver a comprehensive AI-powered memory system that enables intelligent context management and learning for human-AI collaboration
- Provide enterprise-grade memory operations with advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and seamless workflow integration
- Establish a self-improving platform that learns from interactions and optimizes performance through continuous AI enhancement
- Create a unified development experience with integrated testing, documentation, and project management capabilities
- Enable memory-first development workflows that reduce context switching and improve decision-making quality

### Background Context

The Memory-C* system addresses the critical challenge of context management and knowledge persistence in AI-driven development environments. Traditional development workflows suffer from context loss, fragmented knowledge management, and lack of intelligent learning from past interactions. Memory-C* solves this by providing a comprehensive memory layer that not only stores information but actively learns, predicts, and enhances human-AI collaboration.

Built on the foundation of the mem0 framework, Memory-C* extends beyond basic memory operations to include advanced AI analytics, predictive modeling, and seamless integration with development workflows. The system represents a paradigm shift toward memory-first development, where context awareness and intelligent learning drive productivity and decision quality.
