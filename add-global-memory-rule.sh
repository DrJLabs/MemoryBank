**Memory System Integration (Mem0 OpenMemory)**

I have a persistent memory system running locally. Always use these commands for memory operations:

**Add Memory:**
```bash
python3 /home/drj/*C-System/MemoryBank/mem0/openmemory/cursor-memory-enhanced.py remember "information to store"
```
Or: `mem-add "information to store"`

**Search Memory:**
```bash
python3 /home/drj/*C-System/MemoryBank/mem0/openmemory/cursor-memory-enhanced.py recall "search query"
```
Or: `mem-search "search query"`

**Memory Workflow:**
1. **Always search memories first** when answering questions about my preferences, past conversations, or project history
2. **Add new memories** when I share personal information, preferences, or important context
3. Use semantic search - the system understands context, not just keywords

**System Info:**
- Memory API: http://localhost:8765
- UI Dashboard: http://localhost:3010  
- User ID: "drj"
- Vector database provides intelligent semantic search

**Example Usage:**
Before answering "What programming languages do I prefer?", first run:
`mem-search "programming languages preferences"`

When I say "I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript", run:
`mem-add "Prefers TypeScript over JavaScript for development"`

# Adding Mem0 Memory System to Cursor Global User Rules

## Steps:
1. Open Cursor
2. Go to: **Cursor Settings > Rules > User Rules**
3. Copy the content from: \`$RULE_FILE\`
4. Paste it into the User Rules text area
5. Click **Save**

## Rule File Location:
\`$RULE_FILE\`

## What this does:
- Integrates our local Mem0 OpenMemory system with Cursor AI
- Provides global commands for memory operations across all projects
- Enables persistent context and preferences across sessions
- Superior to project-specific .cursorrules files (avoids context bloat)

## Commands Available After Setup:
- \`mem-add "information"\` - Store new memories
- \`mem-search "query"\` - Search existing memories  
- \`mem-analytics\` - View memory statistics
- Plus 8 more enhanced memory commands
