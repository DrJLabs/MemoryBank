# Testing Renovation Log

This document tracks the progress of the testing renovation effort on the `renovate` branch. The goal is to address the critical testing gaps identified in the initial analysis.

## Completed Tasks

The following high-priority testing gaps have been addressed:

### 1. Core Service API Tests (`mem0`)
- **Issue:** The entire high-level test suite in `mem0/tests/test_memory.py` was skipped.
- **Resolution:** Replaced the skipped tests with a comprehensive test suite that mocks underlying dependencies and validates the public API methods (`add`, `get`, `update`, `delete`, `search`, `list`).

### 2. Frontend UI Testing Framework (`mem0/openmemory/ui`)
- **Issue:** The UI had 0% test coverage and no testing framework configured.
- **Resolution:** Installed and configured Jest, React Testing Library, and all necessary dependencies. Created a `jest.config.mjs` and `jest.setup.js`. Wrote the first passing component test for `Navbar.tsx`, establishing a working test pipeline and a pattern for future tests.

### 3. Custom GPT Adapter API Client (`custom-gpt-adapter`)
- **Issue:** The `MemoryBankClient` had no dedicated tests, especially for failure modes.
- **Resolution:** Created a new test file (`custom-gpt-adapter/tests/clients/test_memory_bank_client.py`) with comprehensive tests using `pytest-httpx`. The new suite covers successful API calls, HTTP error handling, network errors, and the circuit breaker logic.

### 4. Memory Bank API Entry Point (`mem0/openmemory/api`)
- **Issue:** The main FastAPI application startup and routing were not directly tested.
- **Resolution:** Created a new integration test file (`mem0/openmemory/api/test_main.py`) using FastAPI's `TestClient`. The test verifies that the application starts correctly, dependencies are overridden for testing, and a core API endpoint is reachable.

### 5. Vector Store Integration (`mem0/vector_stores`)
- **Issue:** Vector store integration modules had little to no test coverage.
- **Resolution:** Created a new test file for the Qdrant integration (`mem0/tests/vector_stores/test_qdrant.py`). The tests mock the external `qdrant_client` to ensure our wrapper logic is correct, establishing a clear pattern for testing other vector store modules.

## Remaining Tasks

The following lower-priority items from the analysis are yet to be addressed:

-   **Authentication & Security Modules:** Add more specific tests for edge cases like expired tokens and permission denials in both the core service and the adapter.
-   **Background Worker Logic (Celery Tasks):** Add direct tests for asynchronous worker tasks in the adapter (e.g., `app/workers/memory_processor.py`).
-   **Audit Logging and Rate Limiting:** Add dedicated tests for the `AuditService` and `RateLimiter` in the adapter to verify their logic.
-   **Monitoring and Metrics Code:** Add basic tests to ensure monitoring endpoints (`/metrics`) are available and that sample metrics are recorded correctly.
-   **DevOps and Infrastructure Scripts:** Consider adding basic smoke tests for critical helper scripts (e.g., `infrastructure/memory-dev.sh`) to prevent configuration drift.
